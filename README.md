## About This Game
Tile Game is a fun little project I have created
in order to improve my skills in programming,
as well as to just have some fun! Everything,
from the code to the art is created by me.

## But, What Do You DO In The Game?
This game combines many aspects from my most
favorite games, such as The Legend of Zelda,
Minecraft, Octopath Traveller, and Skyrim.
The main concept is exploration in order to
become stronger and stronger. By searching
inside of caves, buildings, etc. you can find
useful items, such as weapons, armor, or food.
There will also be quests given from NPC's,
and some traditional RPG elements.
