## About This Game
Tile Game is a fun little project I have created
in order to improve my skills in programming,
as well as to just have some fun! Everything,
from the code to the art is created by me.

## But, What Do You DO In The Game?
This game combines many aspects from my most
favorite games, such as The Legend of Zelda,
Minecraft, Octopath Traveller, and Skyrim.
The main concept is exploration in order to
become stronger and stronger. By searching
inside of caves, buildings, etc. you can find
useful items, such as weapons, armor, or food.
There will also be quests given from NPC's,
and some traditional RPG elements.

 ## What Kind Of Code Goes Into The Game?
 Tile Game is written entierly in C++ with the use of the SFML library. 
 There are a lot of different techniques and coding features that go into
 creating a game like this, so here is a short list describing many of the primary ones:
 - Multithreading
   - Used to seperate different tasks withing the game, such as specific threads used for pathfinding alrogirthims.
   - Helpful to ensure that the overall game doesn't slow when one specific task gets run.
 - Resource Files
   - Encodes textures, sounds, etc. into the actual .exe to prevent being tampered with by users.
   - Easily load resources into memory to be used in the actual game.
 - Custom Binary Files
   - Allows the saving of world, building, and player data.
   - Prevents hard-coding certain features of the game.
   - Allows the game to be more versatile, allowing users to change their worlds to their liking.
 - External Tools
   - Used for creating the .tgw .tgb files easily.
 - Optimization Algorithims
   - Helps lower CPU usage and makes the game run faster overall.
   - Makes the game run easier on lower-end computers.
   - Unfortunately uses more RAM, as per the RAM-CPU Tradeoff Rule.
